Abstract


Humans learn to predict patterns in flexible ways.  Pat-terns are generated from a set of rules.  Mathematical se-quences  are  a  kind  of  patterns  with  rules  correspondingto  basic  mathematical  operations  like  addition  and  mul-tiplication.   Once a person understands the mathematicalrules,  she  could  effortlessly  generalize  those  concepts  toother numbers and other combinations of rules.  Althoughthe state-of-the art RNN architectures like LSTMs are con-sidered to perform well on temporal data, they require vastamounts  of  training  examples  and  still  struggle  to  gener-alize  well.   Our  results  show  that  people  does  well  evenwhen  the  sequences  are  slightly  corrupted.   Humans  aresmart enough to disregard the noise and understand the rulethat generated the sequence. Our proposed Bayesian modelcaptures these human-like learning abilities to predict nextnumber in a given sequence.
